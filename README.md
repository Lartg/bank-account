# bank-account

This is an assignment for one of my CS classes. 
The first part of the code demonstrates my ability to create a class, then I demo the function use. 
The second part is what I had fun with, creating a banking simulation. Its not perfect, but it was fun to build

## Tools Used
-Python 3

## Getting Started

Download or copy my code, delete the demo-ing, and run it in your terminal.

## Things to Improve

Initialize interaction by asking if a new or existing user, that way authentication only needs to happen once.
I'm sure there's a lot more, but that's what would be my first revision focus.
